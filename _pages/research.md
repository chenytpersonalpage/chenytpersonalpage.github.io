#### **Bridging the Gap Between Stencil and Convolution**
Advisor: Dr. Kun Li | Microsoft Research Asia

This project analyzed the similarities and differences between stencils and convolutions and optimized them for acceleration on GPUs based on the characteristics of GPU hardware. 
- Currently, I have developed and proposed a new Tensor core algorithm for stencil computing, based on the img2col approach, that leverages Tensor core processing power for single-channel computations.


#### **Stencil Computing on Heterogeneous Platform**
Advisor: Dr. Kun Li | Microsoft Research Asia

It is the first system for high-performance Stencil on heterogeneous CPU+GPU with novel optimizations on both CPU and GPU. It leverages Pattern Mapping by Register-level Tetrominoes to efficiently utilize SIMD on CPUs and Tensor Cores on GPUs. It also leverages locality by cache/SMEM-level tetrominoes and implement CPU and GPU Collaboration.

- Implemented a new CPU SIMD register level algorithm for stencil computing, resulting in significant performance improvements of 6.3\% - 19.9\% on different stencil kernel shapes.
- Replicated the tessellate tiling (SC '17) to be coordinated with SIMD algorithm.
- Designed a data exchange method between CPU and GPU for stencil computation which covers the communication latency by computation.

#### **Mobile Platform Resource Scheduling**
Advisor: Prof. Lei Liu | Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

It is called MobiRL, a reinforcement learning-based resource scheduler for mobile systems.  It uses a DDPG model to dynamically adjust the upper and lower frequency limits of the CPU's different clusters and the GPU on mobile devices, in order to achieve the effect of simultaneously reducing frame loss rate and power consumption.

- Implemented a resource scheduling framework for Android devices using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) model to optimize performance.
- Designed a piecewise reward function that optimizes energy consumption while limiting frame loss rate, ensuring both efficient use of resources and a high-quality user experience.

#### **Intelligent Resource Scheduling for Co-located Services**
Advisor: Prof. Lei Liu | Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

It is called OSML which employs multiple ML models to work collaboratively to predict QoS variations, shepherd the scheduling, and recover from QoS violations in complicated co-location services. Experimental results show that OSML supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower scheduling overheads and shorter convergence time than previous studies.

- Divided the DQN model into two parts to prevent incorrect scheduling decisions and ensure the QoS.
- Designed a resource sharing policy, such as shared cacheline, to optimize resource utilization across co-located services.
- Tuned PARTIES (ASPLOS '19) and CLITE (HPCA '20) for the evaluation and collected and annotated program resource allocation data.

#### **NVMâ€‘aware thread scheduling approach on NUMA systems**
Advisor: Prof. Lei Liu | Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

It is an NVM-aware thread scheduling approach for NUMA systems with hybrid memory, utilizing the LinUCB algorithm to guide scheduling decisions and reduce program execution time by up to 59.9\%.

- Found the significant difference in local and remote access bandwidth between NVM and DRAM led to performance loss for existing schedulers.
- Carefully selected appropriate features and used LinUCB to guide thread scheduling, resulting in improved performance.
