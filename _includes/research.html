<p>Advisor: Dr. Kun Li | Microsoft Research Asia</p>
<p>This project analyzed the similarities and differences between stencils and convolutions and optimized them for acceleration on GPUs based on the characteristics of GPU hardware. </p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, I have developed and proposed a new Tensor core algorithm for stencil computing, based on the img2col approach, that leverages Tensor core processing power for single-channel computations.</li>

<p>Advisor: Dr. Kun Li | Microsoft Research Asia</p>
<p>It is the first system for high-performance Stencil on heterogeneous CPU+GPU with novel optimizations on both CPU and GPU. It leverages Pattern Mapping by Register-level Tetrominoes to efficiently utilize SIMD on CPUs and Tensor Cores on GPUs. It also leverages locality by cache/SMEM-level tetrominoes and implement CPU and GPU Collaboration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a new CPU SIMD register level algorithm for stencil computing, resulting in significant performance improvements of 6.3% - 19.9% on different stencil kernel shapes.</li>
<li>Replicated the tessellate tiling (SC &#39;17) to be coordinated with SIMD algorithm.</li>
<li><p>Designed a data exchange method between CPU and GPU for stencil computation which covers the communication latency by computation.</p>

<p>It is called MobiRL, a reinforcement learning-based resource scheduler for mobile systems.  It uses a DDPG model to dynamically adjust the upper and lower frequency limits of the CPU&#39;s different clusters and the GPU on mobile devices, in order to achieve the effect of simultaneously reducing frame loss rate and power consumption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a resource scheduling framework for Android devices using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) model to optimize performance.</li>
<li>Designed a piecewise reward function that optimizes energy consumption while limiting frame loss rate, ensuring both efficient use of resources and a high-quality user experience.</li>

<p>Advisor: Prof. Lei Liu | Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>It is called OSML which employs multiple ML models to work collaboratively to predict QoS variations, shepherd the scheduling, and recover from QoS violations in complicated co-location services. Experimental results show that OSML supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower scheduling overheads and shorter convergence time than previous studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Divided the DQN model into two parts to prevent incorrect scheduling decisions and ensure the QoS.</li>
<li>Designed a resource sharing policy, such as shared cacheline, to optimize resource utilization across co-located services.</li>
<li>Tuned PARTIES (ASPLOS &#39;19) and CLITE (HPCA &#39;20) for the evaluation and collected and annotated program resource allocation data.</li>

<p>Advisor: Prof. Lei Liu | Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>It is an NVM-aware thread scheduling approach for NUMA systems with hybrid memory, utilizing the LinUCB algorithm to guide scheduling decisions and reduce program execution time by up to 59.9\%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Found the significant difference in local and remote access bandwidth between NVM and DRAM led to performance loss for existing schedulers.</li>
